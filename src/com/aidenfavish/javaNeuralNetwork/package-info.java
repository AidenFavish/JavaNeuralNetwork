/**
 * The Java Neural Network is a project designed to help use complex machine learning processes that
 * are often written in Python, in Java. This project helps explore the deep parts of neural networks to
 * make very hands on changes. Efficiency is however not priority number 1 (because if it was you wouldn't
 * be using Java), however multithreading and complex fast matrix operations are coming soon; more compatability
 * and learning features are prioritized higher.
